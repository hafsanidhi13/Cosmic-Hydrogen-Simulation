# Cosmic-Hydrogen-Simulation
The goal of this lifelong project is to facilitate the detection of cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI) from the dark ages and the cosmic dawn (the first 400 million years of the universe). HI emits a signal of 21-cm wavelength (1420 MHz) which can be used to create a tomographic map of the universe in three dimensions, the third dimension being time.
